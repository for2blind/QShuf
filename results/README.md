# Results (`/results`)

This directory is the default output location for all experimental artifacts.

- **`/logs`**: Stores the raw log files generated by the experiment scripts.
- **`evaluation_record`**: Contains detailed records for each function invocation, such as start time, end time, and status code.
- **`summary.csv`**: The final, summarized data. It contains key performance indicators (KPIs) extracted and calculated from the raw data, such as average latency, throughput, and GPU utilization. The charts and tables in the paper are primarily generated from this file.
